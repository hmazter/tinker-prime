# Tinkering with primes
Some random tinkering with [symfony/Console](https://github.com/symfony/Console) and [phpspec](http://www.phpspec.net/en/latest/) using prime numbers as test subject.

Much of the code is coming from the Laracast https://laracasts.com/series/code-katas-in-php/episodes/1 which has code published here https://github.com/laracasts/Code-Katas-in-PHP/tree/master/prime-factors
